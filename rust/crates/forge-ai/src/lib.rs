//! Jade AI inline-completion backend — Rust port of
//! `src/main/inline-completion.ts` (the Electron main-process class
//! `InlineCompletionBackend`).
//!
//! The backend speaks llama.cpp's HTTP `/infill` (fill-in-the-middle) + `/health`
//! API. It resolves an endpoint in three steps and, failing that, spawns and
//! supervises its own `llama-server` child process (TS :7-13):
//!   1. `JADE_FIM_ENDPOINT` env var (user-managed server, any host)
//!   2. `http://127.0.0.1:8012` (llama.vscode convention — adopt if running)
//!   3. `http://127.0.0.1:8630` (our managed port — adopts a crashed run's orphan)
//!   4. spawn our own `llama-server` with a small FIM model (downloads on first run)
//!
//! See `docs/jade-feature-inventory.md` §8.7 for the preserved contract. This is
//! a "thin client" identity feature: any server honoring `/health` +
//! `/infill {content}` can replace the managed one via `JADE_FIM_ENDPOINT`.
//!
//! No GUI dependencies: status is published over a [`tokio::sync::watch`] channel
//! (the analogue of the TS `onStatus` listener list, TS :113-115) for Phase-3
//! wiring to consume.
